%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%   Data handler  %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Data handler will help you to "extract a small part of a input data" and
generate training data and test data as input to feed into a classifier.


Example 1: from AT&T image data, you use pickDataClass£¨£© subroutine explained below
to select 5 class (50 images) and store the results in an data array or a data file.

Example 2: from AT&T all data, or subset of it as the result of Example 1, generate a 
training data using the first 9 images of a class and the test data using the class 1 image of the class. 
This is done for all class in the input file. 

Suppose, we use AT&T50 data. 
Then the training data contains 
9*5=45 images and the list of corresponding class labels. This is the trainDataXY.txt.
The test data contains 1*5=40 images
and the list of corresponding class labels. This is the testDataXY.txt.
In computer exam, we give you testDataX.txt (no class labels in the test data file. Your task is to predict class labels.

Example 3. Generate a 2-class data as the input to the 2-class SVM classifier.
  From the hand-written-letter data, you first use "pickDataClass" subroutine and pick 
  "C" and "F" classes and store them in a file or an array.
  Then you use ¡°splitData2TestTrain" split the data: using the first 30 images in "C" and in "F" 
  to form the training data, and using the remaining 9 images in each class to form the 
  test data. Thus the training data contains 30*2 images, the test data contains 9*2 images.

You need to write:

subroutine-1: pickDataClass(filename, class_ids)
 
  filename: char_string specifing the data file to read. For example, 'ATNT_face_image.txt'
  class_ids:  array that contains the classes to be pick. For example: (3, 5, 8, 9)
  Returns: an multi-dimension array or a file, containing the data (both attribute vectors and class labels) 
           of the selected classes
  We use this subroutine to pick a small part of the data to do experiments. For example for handwrittenletter data,
  we can pick classes "C" and "F" for a 2-class experiment. Or we pick "A,B,C,D,E" for a 5-class experiment. 


  test_instances: the data instances in each class to be used as test data.
  We assume that the remaining data instances in each class (after the test data instances are taken out) will ne
  training_instances


subroutine-2: splitData2TestTrain(filename, number_per_class,  test_instances)
  filename: char_string specifing the data file to read. This can also be an array containing input data.
  number_per_class: number of data instances in each class (we assume every class has the same number of data instances)
  test_instances: the data instances in each class to be used as test data.
                  We assume that the remaining data instances in each class (after the test data instances are taken out) 
                  will be training_instances 
  Return/output: Training_attributeVector(trainX), Training_labels(trainY), Test_attributeVectors(testX), Test_labels(testY)
  The data should easily feed into a classifier.

  Example: splitData2TestTrain('Handwrittenletters.txt', 39, 1:20) 
           Use entire 26-class handwrittenletters data. Each class has 39 instances.
           In every class, first 20 images for testing, remaining 19 images for training

subroutine-3:
   This routine will store (trainX,trainY) into a training data file, 
   and store (testX,testY) into a test data file. The format of these files is determined by 
   student's choice: could be a matlab file, a text file, or a file convenient for Pythorn.  
   These file should allow the data to be easily read and feed into a classifier.
   During a COMPUTER QUIZ, you use this routine to save the files and submit them as part of the quiz results.


Subroutine-4: "letter_2_digit_convert" that converts a character string to an integer array. 
   For example,letter_2_digit_convert('ACFG') returns array (1, 3, 6, 7). 
   A COMPUTER QUIZ problem could be: Pick 5 classes with letters 'great' from the hand-written-letter data, and 
     generate training and testing data using first 20 images of each class for training and the rest 19 images for test.
     You will need to use  letter_2_digit_convert('GREAT') to convert to numbers and then subroutine-1 to pick the subset
     of the needed data.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

In computer quiz, it is very likely that the quiz problem/task is

On handwritten letter data, 
pick 10 classes accorindg to some method (to be explain during the quiz).
You use the handler routine to generate training and test data files.
Using the first 10 images in each class to form the training data. 
Using the remaining 29 images in each class to form the test data.
It is also possible that we use first 5 images in each class for training, 
and remaining 34 images in each class for testing.
Whether it is (train=10 test=29) split or (train=5 test=34) split, or some other split,
that will be determined during the quiz.

After you generate the training data and test data,
you need to fead them into classifier, i.e., train the classifier, 
and compute the class labels for for each test data instance.
You need to submit these predicted class labels. 
What classifier to use in quiz is determined at quiz time.
